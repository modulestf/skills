# Smoke test of the isolated plan runner. Needs a local Docker runtime and network access
# for the image builds; uses no AWS account and no real credentials.
#
# It plans smoke/example with made-up session credentials and probes the network after
# each phase. Success means:
# - init reaches the registry and download hosts, and not AWS;
# - plan reaches STS through the plan-phase proxy and STS rejects the made-up key
#   (InvalidClientTokenId), which proves the path to AWS without any real credential;
# - during plan the registry, GitHub, EC2 public DNS names and S3 bucket hosts are refused;
# - a direct connection that bypasses the proxy fails, and outside names do not resolve;
# - plain HTTP through the proxy is refused;
# - credentials without a session token are refused before anything starts;
# - an oversized file in the output directory is refused;
# - with --base, only the example whose plan is a code-error is re-run at the merge base;
# - run-pass.sh's network check, behind each proxy, finds every path closed and both positive
#   controls held, and stops the run before any session when IPv6 is on, a path is open or a
#   control fails;
# - no credential value is in the configuration of a plan container (docker inspect);
# - the image tag is derived from the image files unless PLAN_RUNNER_TAG sets it;
# - no container, network or volume of these runs is left behind.
